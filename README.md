A Virtualization Orchestration Layer

Note; This is not a final product. This is only for reference and code versioning. (Currently only for personal use)
Several other files needed to run the code.

Three more files containing the following are needed 
        1) List of all the available machines' ip addresses
        2) The type of virtual machines that can be booted (containing number of cpu, ram size, hard-disk size)
        3) Location of the images of all the OS to be used
